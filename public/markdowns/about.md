My name is Le Duc Thinh and I'm living in one of the most beautiful city in the world - Toronto, Canada.

I have a Finance and Banking bachelor's degree in Viet Nam and continue my learning path to pursue Computer Science in Canada.

At work, I'm an inquisitive person who loves to learn new things so I can catch up with the fast-growing technology nowadays. Working underpressure is no obstacle but stimulation for me to stay competitive. Moreover, I did participate in 2 start-ups before. Despite failing, I managed to learn valuable experiences!

Off work, I love to socialize and play soccer. I'm an Arsenal fan by the way. I also love to travel, I used to backpack around Viet Nam back then. Singing is my secret talent and I did actually make a karaoke website for me and my friends to sing during the pandamic! I hope I would be a star someday! I'm also something of a scientist myself, I love to learn more about astronomy and physics in my leisure time.

Being a computer guy who has a background in finance and banking, and experience of working in marketing field might give me an edge for my future career. I hope I could find the path that best fit to me!
